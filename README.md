ZENITH CLOUD is one of my course designs in 2016. I brought up this idea since there was no such convenient service in the school LAN. ZENITH CLOUD is a simple cloud storage system, it's running on one of my server in BUPT now. The school LAN provides high-speed upload/download ability, and using ZENITH CLOUD will never consume paid traffic.

You can visit ZENITH CLOUD at now. A client for Windows system is also provided. The server for that client is written in GO, you can find it at [ZENITH CLOUD GO SERVER](https://github.com/Forec/cloud-storage).
